# Chipotle Clone

This project is a Chipotle-Clone site, implemented with **React**. 
I created this mock site in order to strengthen my design skills and to become familiar with developing sites from a wireframe. 
A combination of **Bootstrap and SASS** were utilized to mimic the finer details and to execute their designed UX and UI.

On the navbar, the links are working, however, the pages, besides the icons, all direct to one “Under Construction” page. 
There is a responsive menu when the window is condensed. 
The animations and transitions from the Sign In, Account page, and Shopping Bag are implemented as well. 

On the Homepage, a video element was utilized in displaying the mp4, which autoplays and loops. 
For the Menu Items, Boostrap grid was used for placement, and scale and hover techniques were used for the UX. 
The Menu Items are not working links.

 ***This site is mobile responsive***.
